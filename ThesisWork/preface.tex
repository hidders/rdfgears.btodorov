\chapter{\label{cha:Preface}Preface}

This master thesis is the final work of my study at Delft University of Technology. In parallel with the thesis I also worked part-time for the Web Information Systems (WIS) group where one of my tasks was to build several U-Sem services myself. This gave me the chance to personally experience the problems that scientists face every day and helped me to generate a lot of ideas on how to improve that situation. At the end, it also gave me the confidence that my work is not just another master thesis but it is actually something that will save a lot of time and efforts to scientists and hopefully, help them create ever grater user modelling algorithms.

I really want to take this opportunity to acknowledge all of those who have given me support and guidance during my studies. I would like to thank everyone from the WIS group and especially my supervisors Jan Hidders and Jasper Oosterman who helped me a lot with my daily struggles. And last but not definitely not least I am really grateful to Prof. Houben for all his support and for the wonderful opportunity to be part of his team.
