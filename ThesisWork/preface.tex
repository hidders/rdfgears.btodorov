\chapter{\label{cha:Preface}Preface}

This master thesis is the final work of my study at Delft University of Technology. As part of my part-time job for the WIS group I had to  build several U-Sem services myself which gave me the chance to personally experience the problems that scientists face every day. This helped me to generate a lot of ideas on how to improve that situation. At the end, it also gave me the confidence that my work is not just  another master thesis but it is actually something that will be used, save a lot of time and efforts to the scientists and hopefully, help them create ever grater user modelling algorithms.

I really want to take this opportunity to acknowledge all of those who have given me support and guidance during my studies. I would like to thank everyone from the WIS group and especially my supervisors Jan Hidders and Jasper Oosterman who helped me a lot with my daily struggles. And last but not definitely not least I am really grateful to Prof. Houben for all his support and for the wonderful opportunity to be part of his team.
