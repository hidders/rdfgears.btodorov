This thesis describes the design and implementation of the U-Sem platform. It extends the U-Sem framework for building user modelling services by providing a platform that facilitates the work of engineers building such services. Investigating the needs of the engineers we incorporate two main features in the design of the system.

First, we introduce a plug-in based architecture which enables engineers to plug their custom RDF Gears components and the related resources in the system on demand and without disturbing the work of other users using the system. We also propose a mechanism for collaboration between engineers on component level and a tool that facilitates the process of building plug-ins for the U-Sem platform. 

Secondly, we propose a solution integrated in U-Sem that is capable of supporting the data management tasks in the services. It enables engineers to store, manipulate and perform complex queries on RGL data structures without having to program custom components and be aware of how and where data is actually stored. We also propose mechanism which enables engineers to collaborate on data level. Finally, we integrate the two features to completely automate the installation and configuration of plug-ins that provide U-Sem services containing data management components.
