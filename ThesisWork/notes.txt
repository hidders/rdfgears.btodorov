Abstract:

We extend the U-Sem framework by providing a platform that facilitates the work of engineers developing user modeling services 
following the U-Sem approach.


	
Introduction:

internet is used a lot -> a lot of personal info -> a lot of fields are interested to gain benefits from that data(eg.)
-> many engineers provide algorithms for analysis -> apart from the alrogithms the have a lot of over head work -> solution that makes
engineers more productive by saving them time, efforts and abaling to collaborate with each other.
