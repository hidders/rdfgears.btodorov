Evaluation summary:

In order to evaluate whether this goal is achieved we performed experiments and asked engineers to test the proposed solution in real 
world scenarios. The results presented in Sections ... confirmed that the solution actually facilitates the process of building 
U-Sem services by redusing the number of overhead tasks that engineers have to perform enabling them to focus on the core of their work. 
It saves them time, efforts and also reduces the amount of knowlege required in order to work with the system which also facilitates 
the process of training new engineers. The results also revealed that the solution additionally improves the performance of 
engineers by enabling them to collaborate effectively with each other. Therefore, we are confident that we have achieved the research goal 
and the proposed solution actually serves its purpose.
